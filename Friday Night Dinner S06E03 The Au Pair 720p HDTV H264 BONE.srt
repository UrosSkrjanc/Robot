Hello, boys.<font color="#ffff00">Agh.</font>

2
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,639
Someone's here to see you.

3
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,999
It's Gibby!

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
<font color="#00ff00">I am Gibby.</font>

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,519
<font color="#00ffff">Er, hi, Gibby.</font>

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,320
Well, come in, come in.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,040
Can you believe it? It's Gibby.

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,479
<font color="#00ff00">You are the Jonny?</font>

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,919
<font color="#00ffff">Er, yup.</font>

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,179
<font color="#00ff00">And you are the Adam.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Or just "Adam".</font>

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,959
<font color="#00ff00">I am the Gibby.</font>

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
What an amazing surprise, eh, boys?

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,079
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, it would be if we...</font>

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,639
UNDER HIS BREATH:
<font color="#00ffff">..knew who she was.</font>

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,440
What? Don't be silly.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,240
It's Gibby.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,520
<font color="#00ff00">To them I am a mystery.</font>

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,139
<font color="#00ff00">Oh.</font>

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,539
Oh, Gibby?

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,879
Oh, why were you
so horrible to Gibby?

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,319
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font><font color="#ffff00">Who's Gibby?</font>

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,759
<font color="#00ff00">I am Gibby.</font>

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,279
<font color="#ffff00">Who, is she?</font>
She's your bloody au pair.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,679
<font color="#00ffff">So, we have an au pair now, do we?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'll get the potty.</font>

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,959
Not now, stupid, your old au pair.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,259
She's come to visit.<font color="#ffff00">Old au pair?</font>

29
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,060
Yes, you were four,
and Jonny was a baby.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,719
Yes, you were four,
and Jonny was a baby.

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
From Switzerland? Liked animals?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,419
Used to cry quite a lot.

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,039
<font color="#00ff00">The memory of me, it has vanished.</font>

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,880
What? Of course the memory
of you hasn't vanished.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
BOTH:<font color="#00ff00">The memory of you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hasn't vanished.</font>

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,040
There we are.

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,639
<font color="#00ff00">I am Gibby.</font>

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,440
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God.</font>

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,240
Come though, darling.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,119
<font color="#00ff00">Well, did they remember her?</font>

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,839
GIBBY CRIES

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,279
<font color="#00ffff">She seems stable.</font>

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,080
Oh, why did you have to
say anything?

44
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,999
<font color="#00ff00">What?</font>

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
KNOCKS ON DOOR
Gibby?

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,039
<font color="#00ff00">Excuse me,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I am using the facilities.</font>

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,739
She's using the facilities?

48
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,540
URINATING

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
<font color="#00ffff">She's using the facilities.</font>

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
<font color="#00ff00">Well, they're obviously</font>
<font color="#00ff00">excellent facilities.</font>

51
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,559
<font color="#00ff00">Well, they're obviously</font>
<font color="#00ff00">excellent facilities.</font>

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
<font color="#00ffff">She's still in there?</font>Shhh.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,400
<font color="#ffff00">But who just turns up?</font>
Stop it, will you?

54
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,359
<font color="#ffff00">But who just turns up?</font>
Stop it, will you?

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,239
<font color="#00ffff">So, how long's she staying?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Five bleeding nights.</font>

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,040
All right, Martin.

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,840
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, five nights</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with a total nutjob.</font>

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,760
She's not a nutjob.

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,039
<font color="#ffff00">No, he said "total nutjob".</font>
MARTIN LAUGHS

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
Martin.

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,640
She's just a little emotional.

62
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,039
Gibby was always a little
emotional, wasn't she, Martin?

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,479
<font color="#00ff00">A little emotional?</font>

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,119
Oh, she was so sweet,
she used to love it here.

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,920
And you know, she's already
asked about having a cream tea.

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,759
And you know, she's already
asked about having a cream tea.

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,219
JACKIE LAUGHS
<font color="#00ff00">Only 40 bloody times.</font>

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,619
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, having a cream tea?</font>

69
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,199
<font color="#ffff00">What? Like scones and cream and jam?</font>

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,779
Yeah. Don't you remember?

71
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,580
Gibby used to go to the
hotel round the corner,

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,359
and have a cream tea every day.

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,679
<font color="#00ffff">Every day she had a cream tea?</font>

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,979
<font color="#ffff00">And you let this woman look</font>
<font color="#ffff00">after your children, did you?</font>

75
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,759
<font color="#00ffff">For a whole year.</font>Very good.

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,299
<font color="#00ffff">While she worked her way</font>
<font color="#00ffff">through 365 cream teas.</font>

77
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,959
Stop it.

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,479
She just tried one once,
and was, you know, hooked.

79
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,759
<font color="#ffff00">Total nutjob.</font>

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,459
Shut up.

81
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,959
You used to adore her,
Adam, adore her.

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,639
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font><font color="#00ff00">I return.</font>

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,440
Oh. There you are, love.
Everything OK now?

84
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,039
Oh. There you are, love.
Everything OK now?

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,679
<font color="#00ff00">Yes. The facilities,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">they are clean.</font>

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,239
Oh. Great.

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,799
<font color="#00ff00">I sit in the vicinity of the boys?</font>

88
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Um.

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,959
<font color="#ffff00">The vicinity.</font>

90
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,800
Aw, Gibby and our little babies.

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,840
Smile!

92
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,780
CLICK
<font color="#00ffff">Mum.</font>Ah, lovely.

93
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,559
CLICK
<font color="#00ffff">Mum.</font>Ah, lovely.

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,939
Aw.

95
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,439
<font color="#00ff00">And now we go for the cream tea?</font>

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,519
<font color="#00ff00">Christ.</font>

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
Er, not now, Gibby, OK?

98
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:07,919
Er, not now, Gibby, OK?

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
<font color="#00ff00">But, you are saying the old hotel,</font>

100
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,319
<font color="#00ff00">But, you are saying the old hotel,</font>

101
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,599
<font color="#00ff00">it is still providing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the cream teas?</font>

102
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,419
Yes, but we'll get a cream
tea another day.

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,039
<font color="#00ff00">Oh.</font>

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,840
<font color="#00ff00">Gibby is very sad.</font>

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,279
Um. Gibby's also visiting
some of the other families

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,859
she worked for all those years ago.

107
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,159
Isn't that...<font color="#00ffff">Weird?</font>

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
<font color="#00ff00">Yes, I am performing all the visits.</font>

109
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,279
<font color="#00ff00">Yes, I am performing all the visits.</font>

<font color="#00ff00">they is very nice.</font>

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
Ooh.

113
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,040
<font color="#00ff00">The family Carter,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">they is the best family.</font>

129
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,119
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, uh, uh.</font>

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,920
<font color="#00ffff">That's it.</font>

131
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,859
<font color="#00ffff">Where's your wound?</font>

132
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,660
<font color="#00ffff">Here.</font>

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
<font color="#ffff00">That's your wound?</font>

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,699
<font color="#00ffff">I don't have any plasters you see.</font>

135
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,639
<font color="#00ffff">And what if a dirty microbe</font>
<font color="#00ffff">got inside the wound</font>

136
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,359
<font color="#00ffff">and travelled all</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the way down to my organs?</font>

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,799
<font color="#00ffff">Your organs?</font>

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,600
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, my kidneys, my livers.</font>

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,640
<font color="#00ff00">You only have one liver, Jim.</font>

140
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,159
<font color="#00ffff">I only have one liver now?</font>

141
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,960
Everything all right?

Everything OK now?

Right, tuck in, everyone.
JACKIE LAUGHS

so don't be shy.

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Er, the food, do you like the taste?

211

<font color="#00ff00">Mm, this is a difficult question.</font>

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,759
Really? Why?

213
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
<font color="#00ff00">Because there is no taste.</font>

214
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,360
<font color="#00ffff">And you're staying here how long?</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Didn't you?</font>

399
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,170
No. I was born without an arm.

400
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:22,869
No. I was born without an arm.

401
