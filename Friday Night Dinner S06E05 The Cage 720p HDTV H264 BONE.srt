00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,320
<c.white>Agh! Pissface!</c>

2
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,960
<c.white>Right.</c><c.yellow> Agh!</c>

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,040
<c.yellow>Pusface!</c><c.white> Get off!</c>

4
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,160
<c.white>Get off, you idiot!</c>

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,920
<c.cyan>Oh, silly boys.</c>

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
<c.yellow>Er, hi, Auntie Val.</c>

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,920
<c.cyan>Well, get up, then.</c>

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,120
<c.white>God, you're such an arsehole.</c>
<c.yellow>You're the arsehole!</c>

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,240
<c.cyan>Oh, you are going to behave tonight,</c>
<c.cyan>aren't you?</c>

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,240
<c.yellow>Sorry, where's our normal mum?</c><c.white> Yeah.</c>

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,840
<c.cyan>Erm, she's not here.</c>

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,480
<c.yellow>Not here?</c><c.white> Murdered her, have you?</c>

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,600
<c.cyan>Oh, very funny.</c>

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
<c.cyan>No, your mum's, erm...in hospital.</c>

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
<c.white>Hospital?</c><c.yellow> What?</c>

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,600
<c.cyan>Don't worry, she's absolutely fine.</c>

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,800
<c.white>Hospital?</c>

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
<c.cyan>She's with your dad.</c>
<c.cyan>They'll be back soon.</c>

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
<c.cyan>She's just had a little...</c>

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,920
<c.cyan>..procedure.</c>

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,560
<c.yellow>What, like a...woman's procedure?</c>

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
<c.cyan>Exactly. A woman's procedure.</c>

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,840
<c.yellow>So that means?</c><c.white> That means don't ask.</c>
<c.yellow>Hm.</c>

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,600
<c.cyan>Correct. So, while Mummy's away,</c>
<c.cyan>I'm Mummy.</c>

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,800
<c.cyan>Aww!</c>

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
<c.yellow>But why didn't she tell us?</c>

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,640
<c.cyan>Cos she didn't want to worry you,</c>
<c.cyan>did she?</c>

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,880
<c.white>Er, we're not children.</c><c.cyan> Naughty!</c>

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,040
<c.white>Sorry. We are children.</c>

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,440
<c.yellow>Dad's handiwork?</c><c.cyan> Have a guess.</c>

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,280
<c.white>I can't believe she didn't say</c>
<c.white>anything.</c>

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
<c.white>CREAM SQUIRTS</c>

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
<c.cyan>Jonny!</c>

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
<c.cyan>She's not having her head removed,</c>
<c.cyan>she's just having a...</c>

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,640
<c.white>BOTH: Woman's procedure.</c>
<c.cyan>That's right.</c>

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
<c.yellow>Whatever that is.</c>

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,000
<c.white>Well, it can only be one of two</c>
<c.white>things, can't it?</c>

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,080
<c.white>Higher or lower.</c>

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,960
<c.cyan>Ugh! Don't be so disgusting.</c>

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,120
<c.white>I reckon higher.</c><c.yellow> Lower.</c>
<c.yellow>Definitely lower.</c>

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,520
<c.white>Hmm... I think higher.</c>

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,720
<c.white>MUFFLED SHOUTING</c>
<c.cyan>Boys!</c>

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,960
<c.yellow>Argh!</c>

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
<c.yellow>Pusface!</c>

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,960
<c.cyan>Anyway, I'm just here to help out a</c>
<c.cyan>little - tidy up, make dinner.</c>

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,760
<c.white>What? But Mum makes dinner</c>
<c.white>on Friday nights.</c><c.yellow> Yeah.</c>

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,520
<c.cyan>Ohhh, but does Mum make roast lamb</c>
<c.cyan>for dinner?</c>

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,600
<c.white>Oh, my God, lamb.</c>
<c.white>SIZZLING</c>

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,920
<c.yellow>I like this new Mummy.</c>
<c.white>You can strangle the old one.</c>

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
<c.cyan>That's my Bobbles. Come on.</c>

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,560
<c.white>Seriously, you can strangle her.</c>

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,680
<c.white>SHE CHUCKLES</c>
<c.cyan>Stop it!</c>

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,440
<c.cyan>So...I hear you've got yourself</c>
<c.cyan>a girlfriend.</c>

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,840
<c.white>Ohh, Auntie...</c>

55
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
<c.cyan>We were worried about you.</c>

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,760
<c.white>Jonny's got a girlfriend too,</c>
<c.white>you know. Where is he?</c>

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,520
<c.cyan>I thought maybe you were asexual.</c>

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,320
<c.white>A sexual what?</c>

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,160
<c.cyan>No, asexual - having no sexual needs</c>
<c.cyan>or desires.</c>

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,960
<c.white>Oh, my God.</c><c.yellow> No sexual needs</c>
<c.yellow>or desires.</c>

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,040
<c.white>PHONE CHIMES</c>
<c.white>Ugh.</c>

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
<c.cyan>Ooh.</c><c.yellow> Is that Mum?</c>

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,560
<c.cyan>Not quite.</c>

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,880
<c.yellow>Yeah, that's definitely not Mum.</c>

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,160
<c.cyan>What do you think?</c>

66
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
<c.white>Of the stupid, topless man?</c>
<c.white>SHE TUTS</c>

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,480
<c.cyan>I tell you, this app is full of</c>
<c.cyan>gorgeous men</c>

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,920
<c.cyan>just waiting for my finger.</c>

69
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
<c.yellow>No need to tell us any more.</c>

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,080
<c.cyan>Like, so many.</c><c.yellow> Any more.</c>

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,160
<c.cyan>What about this one?</c>

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,680
<c.white>Also topless.</c><c.cyan> This one's just...</c>
<c.cyan>Oh, my God.</c>

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
<c.white>"Loverboy309"?</c>

74
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,640
<c.yellow>Definitely a sex robot.</c>

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
<c.cyan>His real name's Colin.</c>

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,440
<c.white>Definitely not a sex robot.</c>

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
<c.cyan>I'm obsessed. I've been stalking him</c>
<c.cyan>on here for months.</c>

78
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,280
<c.white>That sounds healthy.</c>

79
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,560
<c.cyan>This one here ate like an effing</c>
<c.cyan>pig.</c><c.yellow> Right.</c>

80
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,080
<c.cyan>I still slept with him!</c><c.yellow> Er...</c>

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
<c.cyan>And with him.</c>

82
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,400
<c.white>Goodbye, then.</c>
<c.white>SHE LAUGHS</c>

83
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,680
<c.white>PHONE CHIMES</c>
<c.cyan>Ooh!</c>

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,280
<c.white>Just keep walking out the house?</c>

85
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,000
<c.cyan>Hi, Bobbles!</c>

86
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,520
<c.white>Hi, Mum!</c><c.yellow> Thank God you're here.</c>

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,760
<c.yellow>Are you all right?</c><c.cyan> I'm fine.</c>
<c.cyan>I'm a bit tired, but I'm fine.</c>

90
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
<c.green>She's quite sore.</c><c.cyan> Thank you.</c>

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
<c.green>Very sore.</c><c.cyan> Martin!</c>

92
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,320
<c.white>I can't believe you didn't tell us.</c>

93
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,800
<c.cyan>I'm sorry,</c>
<c.cyan>but I didn't want to worry you.</c>

94
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
<c.cyan>Ooh!</c>

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,480
<c.green>She really is extremely sore.</c>

96
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
<c.cyan>Seriously?</c>

97
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,600
<c.cyan>You know I had to have a little...</c>

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,280
<c.white>ALL:</c><c.cyan> ..procedure.</c>
<c.white>We know.</c>

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
<c.cyan>What?</c>

100
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,760
<c.white>Higher or lower?</c>

101
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,240
<c.cyan>Ohh, Adam!</c>

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
<c.white>MARTIN LAUGHS</c>
<c.green>Higher or lower!</c>

103
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,200
<c.green>Jackie!</c><c.cyan> Horrible.</c>

104
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
<c.cyan>Where's Val?</c>

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
<c.yellow>In the dining room</c>
<c.yellow>organising an orgy.</c>

106
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,400
<c.cyan>Oh, she's not on that thing again,</c>
<c.cyan>is she?</c>

107
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,600
<c.cyan>It sends her bloody mad.</c>

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
<c.white>Hi, Jackie, welcome home.</c>

109
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,880
<c.cyan>There you are! Thanks for helping</c>
<c.cyan>out.</c>

110
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,440
<c.white>Oh, don't be silly.</c>

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,800
<c.white>Hmm.</c><c.cyan> Aww.</c>

112
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,240
<c.cyan>Er, Val?</c>

113
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,160
<c.white>Oh, sorry. How are you feeling?</c>

114
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,840
<c.green>She's incredibly sore.</c>

115
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,320
<c.cyan>Oh, please stop telling everyone</c>
<c.cyan>I'm sore all the bleeding time.</c>

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
<c.white>Oh, go through.</c>

117
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,440
<c.white>Well?</c>

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
<c.white>And I got your pillow and your</c>
<c.white>blankie.</c>

120
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,000
<c.cyan>Aww, my blankie.</c>

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,480
<c.white>This is your oasis of calm, Jackie.</c>

122
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,680
<c.cyan>Thanks.</c>

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,440
<c.white>And I've prepared a lovely...</c>
<c.white>PHONE CHIMES</c>

124
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,880

<c.white>there's no rush, love.</c>

125
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
<c.white>You eat whenever you're ready.</c>

126
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,160
<c.cyan>Aww, what would we do</c>
<c.cyan>without Auntie Val, eh?</c>

127
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,560
<c.green>Rejoice?</c><c.white> Do you want to eat out of</c>
<c.white>the bin tonight, Martin?</c>

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
<c.green>Ooh, the bin!</c>

129
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,080
<c.white>Yeah, not really a deterrent.</c>

130
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,880
<c.cyan>One minute.</c>

131
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,400
<c.cyan>Oh, not another one!</c>

132
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,920
<c.green>Oh, that's where I put it!</c>
<c.white>SHE SIGHS</c>

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
<c.green>Lads, this stuff is amazing.</c>

134
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,080
<c.green>You can mend anything with it.</c>

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,640
<c.cyan>Yes, and you have been mending</c>
<c.cyan>anything with it.</c>

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
<c.white>LAUGHTER</c>

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,560
<c.white>PHONE RINGS</c>
<c.white>Is that my phone?</c>

138
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
<c.yellow>Is it your phone?</c>

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
<c.white>Huh?</c>

140
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,960
<c.white>Pissface, where have you put it?</c>

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,560
<c.cyan>Boys?</c>

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,640
<c.yellow>Strange.</c>

143
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
<c.yellow>It seems to be coming from in there.</c>

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
<c.white>Jonny...</c>

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
<c.white>Huh?</c>

146
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,320
<c.white>RINGING CONTINUES</c>

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
<c.white>Pissface!</c>

148
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,160

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,600
<c.green>I told you that stuff was good.</c>
<c.green>You should see the reviews.</c>

165
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,160
<c.white>Ooh, do you have a printout?</c>

<c.cyan>OK, will you please stop being</c>
<c.cyan>so horrible to Auntie Val?</c>

171
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,800
<c.cyan>She is making us dinner out of</c>
<c.cyan>the kindness of her heart.</c>

172
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
<c.white>While attempting to sleep with</c>
<c.white>every man in Britain.</c>

173
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,040

<c.cyan>that horrible stuff away!</c>

<c.white>- His name's Colin.</c>
<c.cyan>Colin?</c>

183
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
<c.yellow>Not a very good sex robot.</c>

184
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
<c.white>From my app! I've been</c>
<c.white>stalking him for months.</c>

185
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,000
<c.cyan>Have you?</c>
<c.white>BOTH: Yup.</c>

186

<c.white>Well, just look at him.</c>

187
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,240
<c.cyan>Er, where's his shirt?</c>
<c.yellow>None of them have shirts.</c>

188

192
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,080
<c.white>PHONE CHIMES</c>
<c.white>In 40 minutes!</c>

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,200
<c.cyan>What? From your house?</c>

194
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
<c.white>My house? I don't have time to</c>
<c.white>go to my house, Jackie.</c>

195
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
<c.white>He'll come here.</c>

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
<c.white>BOTH: Here?</c>

197
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,480
<c.cyan>But we haven't had our dinner yet.</c>

198
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,440
<c.white>Sorry, I am not missing out</c>
<c.white>on a piece of that.</c>

199
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,600
<c.white>We'll just have to</c>
<c.white>have dinner now.</c><c.green> Now?</c>

200
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,920
<c.white>Well, we don't want him strolling in</c>
<c.white>while I'm stuffing my face, do we?</c>

201
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,160
<c.cyan>No, of course not, it's just...I'm</c>
<c.cyan>really not ready to eat right now.</c>

202
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,760
<c.white>Dinner is now.</c>

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,000
<c.white>OK, we really don't have long,</c>

204
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
<c.white>so we'll just have to eat</c>
<c.white>as fast as possible.</c>

205
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
<c.cyan>Will we?</c><c.white> Yes.</c>

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,320
<c.white>This lamb's gonna take, what,</c>
<c.white>five minutes to eat?</c>

207
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,600
<c.white>- That'll be enjoyable.</c>
<c.white>- No, four minutes.</c>

208
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,520
<c.yellow>Four minutes for my lovely lamb?</c>

209
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,920
<c.white>And then two minutes for dessert.</c>
<c.green>Bleeding hell, Valerie.</c>

210
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
<c.white>Well, sit down, sit down.</c>

211
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,120
<c.white>Wait! What am I gonna wear?</c>

212
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,600
<c.white>What am I going to wear?</c>

213
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,880
<c.green>A straitjacket?</c>

214
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,640
<c.green>Argh!</c><c.cyan> Valerie!</c>

215
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
<c.white>I'm going to have to wear some of</c>
<c.white>your clothes.</c>

216
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,840
<c.white>Jackie, can I wear some of your</c>
<c.white>clothes?</c>

217
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
<c.white>- Heart attack in precisely ten</c>
<c.white>seconds.</c>

218
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,320
<c.white>- Can I wear some of your clothes,</c>
<c.white>Jackie?</c>

219
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
<c.cyan>Yes, you can wear some of my</c>
<c.cyan>clothes!</c>

220
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,160
<c.white>Well, get on with it! Eat up!</c>

221
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,000
<c.white>Delicious, terrifying dinner.</c>

222
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,640
<c.cyan>Um, Val.</c><c.white> Mm-hm?</c><c.cyan> Maybe you should</c>
<c.cyan>try and take it a bit slower.</c>

223
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,600
<c.white>Slower? Jonathan, you can put more</c>
<c.white>in your mouth, you know.</c>

224
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,680
<c.yellow>Mm?!</c>

225
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,440
<c.white>Mmm!</c><c.cyan> No, I mean with this guy,</c>
<c.cyan>what's his name?</c>

226
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
<c.green>Fuckbot 1000.</c>

227
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,000
<c.green>Ow!</c>

228
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,560
<c.cyan>Martin!</c>
<c.white>DOORBELL RINGS</c>

229
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
<c.white>Where are you all going?</c>

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,160
<c.green>To get the sodding door</c>
<c.green>and then kill ourselves.</c>

231
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
<c.white>You can't all go,</c>
<c.white>it's going to slow everything down.</c>

232
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,560
<c.white>You go, boys. Take your plates.</c>

233
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
<c.white>You can eat on the way.</c>

234
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,080
<c.yellow>Really?</c><c.white> Mmm!</c>

235
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,960
<c.white>Well, get on with it, you two!</c>

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
<c.green>I could be eating out the bin.</c>

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
<c.white>Your boys better not ruin</c>
<c.white>my bloody evening.</c>

238
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,640
<c.cyan>Your bloody evening?</c>

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,360
<c.yellow>Er, Mum?</c><c.cyan> What?</c>

240
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,840
<c.yellow>Why did you order a dog cage?</c>

241
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,680
<c.white>Erm, I had to have the dog cage sent</c>

242
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,120
<c.white>to your house, Jackie, because</c>
<c.white>I didn't want to upset Milson</c>

243
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,960
<c.white>if it turned up at my house.</c>

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
<c.white>- Well, that makes sense.</c>

245
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,520
<c.white>- Milson's a very nervous mammal.</c>

246
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,520
<c.green>Why do you need a bloody dog cage?</c>

247
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,520
<c.yellow>An extra-strong, galvanised steel,</c>
<c.yellow>heavy-duty bloody dog cage?</c>

248
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,960
<c.white>90 seconds to finish your lamb.</c>

249
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
<c.white>90 seconds.</c>

250
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,760
<c.white>- This is a nightmare!</c>
<c.cyan>Jim, why do you need a dog cage?</c>

251
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,200
<c.white>Um, is it all right if we talk</c>
<c.white>in there, Jackie? Away from...</c>

252
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,680
<c.white>..you know.</c>

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
<c.white>MILSON WHINES</c>

254
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
<c.white>The living room.</c>

255
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
<c.cyan>Well?</c>

256
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,640
<c.white>What? Oh, yes! We have to have a</c>
<c.white>cage,</c>

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,240
<c.white>you see, because Milson's been</c>
<c.white>a very bad dog recently.</c>

258
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,800
<c.white>Very bad.</c>

259
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,280
<c.yellow>Really? What's she done?</c>

260
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
<c.white>What hasn't she done?</c>

261
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,280
<c.white>She sat on my chair,</c>
<c.white>she licked a sock, she ate bones.</c>

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,800
<c.green>Er, dogs are meant to eat bones.</c>

263
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,040
<c.white>Are they?</c>

264
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,120
<c.cyan>We're coming, love.</c>
<c.cyan>We're coming.</c><c.white> It's OK.</c>

265
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,760
<c.white>Something's come up.</c>
<c.white>He's gonna pick me up later now.</c>

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
<c.white>Panic over.</c>

267
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
<c.yellow>Panic over?</c>

268
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,800
<c.green>I just swallowed half a bleeding</c>
<c.green>kilogram of meat in three seconds.</c>

269
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
<c.white>Yeah, all right!</c>
<c.white>It wasn't my fault, was it?</c>

270
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,240
<c.green>Well, whose shitting fault was it?</c>

271
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,400
<c.white>Er, Jackie, say something.</c>

272
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,640
<c.cyan>Val, love, I'm really not feeling</c>
<c.cyan>very...</c>

273
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,720
<c.white>Oh, right. I see.</c>

274
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,200
<c.white>Well, thank you very much</c>
<c.white>for the support, Jackie.</c>

275
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,560
<c.cyan>But...</c>

276
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,680
<c.white>And Colin is not a bloody sex robot!</c>

277
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,960
<c.white>- Sex robot?</c>

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,960
<c.cyan>Oh, I need to sit down.</c>

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,840
<c.white>Jackie, is it all right if I</c>
<c.white>assemble the cage in here?</c>

280
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
<c.white>You know, for testing purposes?</c>

281
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,560
<c.white>WHISPERS: Away from Milson.</c>

282
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
<c.cyan>Jim, I really don't care</c>
<c.cyan>what you do tonight, OK?</c>

283
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
<c.white>OK, Jackie.</c>

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,080
<c.white>I'll just pop Milson back home</c>
<c.white>and go and fetch my tools.</c>

285
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,840
<c.white>Ooh, but don't worry I won't need</c>
<c.white>feeding cos I have my peach.</c>

<c.white>I see, Jackie.</c>

293
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,680
<c.white>Higher or lower?</c>

<c.white>HE SLURPS</c>

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,240
<c.white>JIM HUMS TO HIMSELF</c>

296
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,520
<c.white>Well, this is a fantastic evening,</c>

297
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,960
<c.white>watching a grown man bashing away</c>
<c.white>at a giant cage.</c>

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
<c.yellow>Are you sure you need</c>
<c.yellow>all those extra bolts, Jim?</c>

299
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,240
<c.green>Oh, yes, Martin, the cage has to</c>
<c.green>be particularly secure,</c>

300
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
<c.green>otherwise Milson might...</c>

301
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,840
<c.white>HE WHIMPERS</c>

302
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
<c.white>MARTIN SIGHS</c>

303
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,600
<c.yellow>Where's this bloody dessert?</c>
<c.cyan>Better be crumble.</c>

304
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,320
<c.green>Ooh! Crumble!</c>

305
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,600
<c.white>HE GROANS SOFTLY</c>

306
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,040
<c.white>Maybe I should go and talk to her.</c>
<c.white>I've got to say something.</c>

307
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,440
<c.white>- What, like, "Please piss off"?</c>

308
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,560
<c.yellow>Dessert, everyone?</c>

309
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
<c.green>Finally!</c>

310
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,960
<c.white>WHOOSHING</c>

311
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
<c.white>Oh, definitely not, Jim!</c>

312
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,800
<c.yellow>Um, hi.</c>

313
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,160
<c.yellow>I hope you like</c>
<c.yellow>what I've made you all tonight.</c>

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
<c.white>I'm sure we will.</c>

315
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,240
<c.white>- Basically, is it crumble?</c>
<c.green>Yeah.</c><c.yellow> It's a surprise.</c>

316
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,640
<c.cyan>A surprise? What's that bloody mean?</c>

317
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,520
<c.white>Ugh. I'm sorry, love.</c>

318
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,880
<c.yellow>No, I'm sorry, Jackie.</c>

319
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
<c.yellow>I shouldn't have spoken to you</c>
<c.yellow>like that before.</c>

320
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,360
<c.yellow>I overreacted.</c><c.white> You didn't.</c>

321
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
<c.cyan>She did.</c>

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,520
<c.yellow>I think I'm just so nervous about</c>
<c.yellow>meeting this guy later, you know?</c>

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,280
<c.white>Yeah, erm, it's OK.</c>

324
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
<c.yellow>It's your evening and you</c>
<c.yellow>certainly don't need me ruining it.</c>

325
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,360
<c.cyan>We certainly don't.</c>
<c.yellow>Will you shut your bloody face?</c>

326
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,160
<c.yellow>Right! Dessert.</c>

327
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
<c.yellow>Oh, I'm mad - I left it in the</c>
<c.yellow>kitchen!</c>

328
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,480
<c.white>SHE CHUCKLES</c>

329
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,360
<c.white>OK, will you please all stop now?</c>

330
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,240
<c.green>What the hell's a surprise dessert?</c>

331
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,560
<c.white>How do I bloody know?</c>

332
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,760
<c.cyan>Better not be her rice pudding.</c>

333
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,600
<c.white>Oh, God, her rice pudding.</c>

334
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,560
<c.yellow>So thick.</c><c.green> So lumpy.</c>

335
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,960
<c.white>Shhh!</c>

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
<c.white>Vomit in a bowl.</c>

337
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,040
<c.white>ALL: Vomit in a bowl!</c>

338
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,560
<c.white>LAUGHTER</c>

339
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,440
<c.yellow>What are you all laughing at?</c>

340
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,120
<c.cyan>Vomit.</c><c.yellow> Lovely.</c>

341
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,080
<c.yellow>Now, I know how much you like</c>
<c.yellow>your crumble in this house.</c>

342
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,080
<c.white>Crimble crumble!</c><c.yellow> Crimble crumble!</c>

343
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
<c.yellow>But tonight, I thought I'd make you</c>
<c.yellow>something different.</c>

344
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,520
<c.white>Oh, Auntie!</c><c.green> What? Why?</c>

345
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,760
<c.cyan>Shitting hell, Valerie!</c>

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,520
<c.yellow>Ta-da!</c>

347
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,120
<c.yellow>Well, everyone loves Auntie Val's</c>
<c.yellow>rice pudding, don't they?</c>

348
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,960
<c.white>Um... Yeah, of course.</c>

349
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,520
<c.yellow>Nice and wobbly.</c>

350
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,640
<c.cyan>Ugh.</c>

351
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,920
<c.yellow>Actually, tonight, I made this one</c>
<c.yellow>extra wobbly.</c>

352
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,320
<c.white>PHONE CHIMES</c>
<c.yellow>Ooh!</c>

353
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
<c.yellow>Oh.</c><c.cyan> What bloody now?</c>

354
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
<c.white>Are you all right?</c>

355
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,160
<c.yellow>Colin's not coming.</c><c.white> Not coming?</c>

356
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,720
<c.white>- Robot malfunction?</c>

357
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,120
<c.yellow>A "work thing".</c><c.white> Oh, love.</c>

358
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
<c.yellow>Why do men hate me so much?</c>

359
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
<c.white>What? They don't.</c>

360
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,600
<c.white>MEN WHISPER:</c><c.cyan> They do.</c>

361
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,120
<c.white>Oh, Val.</c>

362
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,960
<c.yellow>Do you know, whenever Larry</c>
<c.yellow>ate my rice pudding,</c>

363
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,200
<c.yellow>he'd say to me, "Val, I loved it.</c>

364
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,200
<c.yellow>"That was the best pudding I ever</c>
<c.yellow>had in my life."</c>

365
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,280
<c.white>Yeah, well...it's lovely.</c>

366
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
<c.yellow>And then one night, we're sitting</c>
<c.yellow>there, eating my rice pudding,</c>

367
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,080
<c.yellow>and he turns to me and says,</c>

368
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,240
<c.yellow>"Valerie, I don't love your rice</c>
<c.yellow>pudding any more.</c>

369
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,040
<c.yellow>"In fact, I never loved it."</c>

370
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,520
<c.yellow>But what he really meant was,</c>

371
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,320
<c.yellow>"I don't love you any more.</c>
<c.yellow>I never loved you."</c>

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,520
<c.white>SHE SOBS</c>

373
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,200
<c.white>Val!</c>

374
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,760
<c.cyan>Shit on a shit.</c>

375
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,440
<c.white>We're going to have to eat that now,</c>
<c.white>aren't we?</c>

376
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
<c.white>- Yes, or she'll probably die.</c>

377
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,200
<c.cyan>Why can't we just have</c>
<c.cyan>some bloody ice cream?</c>

378
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,680
<c.white>- Yeah.</c>
<c.white>- Martin, we are eating it.</c>

379
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,560
<c.cyan>So unhappy.</c>

380
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,240
<c.white>Erm, I finished the special cage</c>
<c.white>so I'll just go and get Milson</c>

381
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,160
<c.white>for the, you know, big unveiling.</c>

382
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
<c.white>- OK, Jim.</c>

383
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
<c.green>Er, Jim?</c><c.white> Hmm?</c>

384
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,160
<c.green>Do you like rice pudding?</c><c.white> Jonny!</c>

385
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
<c.white>- Rice pudding?</c>

386
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,520
<c.white>- Erm, my mother used to make me</c>
<c.white>rice pudding.</c>

387
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,280
<c.green>Did she?</c><c.white> Yes, and I hated every</c>
<c.white>mouthful.</c>

388
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,520
<c.cyan>Terrific.</c><c.white> I'd rather eat a bowl of</c>
<c.white>rats' innards</c>

389
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,080
<c.white>than even a thimble of horrid,</c>
<c.white>horrid, horrid rice pudding.</c>

390
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,040
<c.green>Ah, I tried.</c><c.white> Oh, but, Jim!</c>

391
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,320
<c.white>Have you ever eaten Jewish rice</c>
<c.white>pudding?</c>

392
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,640
<c.cyan>Genius.</c>

393
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
<c.white>Jewish rice pudding?</c>

394
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,080
<c.white>- Yes, Jewish rice pudding. It's....</c>

395
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,960
<c.cyan>Delicious.</c><c.white> Is it?</c>

396
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,240
<c.white>ALL: Yes.</c>

397
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,480
<c.green>And did you know it's a great honour</c>

398
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,120
<c.green>for a non-Jew to eat Jewish rice</c>
<c.green>pudding?</c>

399
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,960
<c.white>An honour?</c>

400
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,040
<c.white>- The highest.</c>

401
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,840
<c.white>- I see.</c>

402
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,720
<c.white>But I don't have my little Jewish</c>
<c.white>hat!</c>

403
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080

<c.white>And is this my special Jewish bowl?</c>

407
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,680
<c.white>- Yes, but you have to eat them all,</c>
<c.white>Jim.</c>

408
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,840
<c.white>- That's the tradition.</c>
<c.white>- And quickly.</c>

409
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,160
<c.cyan>Yeah, the quicker you eat, Jim,</c>
<c.cyan>the higher the honour.</c>

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,520
<c.white>- Erm...</c>
<c.white>- Hurry up!</c>

411

<c.white>It's funny - I always hated my</c>
<c.white>mother's rice pudding,</c>

436
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,080
<c.white>but Jewish rice pudding is really,</c>
