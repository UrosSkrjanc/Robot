Oh, Martin! <font color="#00ff00">Ow!</font>

442
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,849
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. It's just a shame</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you never took up running.</font>

443
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,529
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. It's just a shame</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you never took up running.</font>

444
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,569
<font color="#00ffff">Right, well, I'll just start running</font>
<font color="#00ffff">now, then I'll live longer than you.</font>

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,849
<font color="#ffff00">Go on, then.</font>

457
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,889
<font color="#00ff00">March 20th, 2085.</font>

458
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,489

<font color="#ffff00">Great.</font>

461
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,809
You're running now? <font color="#00ff00">Now?</font>

462
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,849
<font color="#00ffff">Yes!</font>You can't run now.
We've got beef.

463
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,689
<font color="#00ffff">Yes!</font>You can't run now.
We've got beef.

464
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,729
<font color="#00ffff">Can you move out of the way,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">please?</font>Jonny!

465
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,569
<font color="#00ffff">Can you move out of the way,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">please?</font>Jonny!

466
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,249
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, he has gone insane.</font>

467
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,289
<font color="#00ffff">Right. Ready, Pusface?</font>

468
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,119
<font color="#00ffff">Right. Ready, Pusface?</font>

469
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,129
<font color="#ffff00">Wait. That's not...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God.</font>

470
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,609
<font color="#ffff00">Wait. That's not...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God.</font>

471
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,729
Horrible Grandma.

472
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,799
<font color="#00ff00">Happy birthday, Martin.</font>

473
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,129
<font color="#00ff00">Happy birthday, Martin.</font>

474
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,199
<font color="#00ffff">Balls!</font>

475
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,090
<font color="#00ffff">Balls!</font>

476
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,469
<font color="#00ff00">Banning me from seeing my son</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on his birthday...</font>

477
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,149
<font color="#00ff00">Banning me from seeing my son</font>
<font color="#00ff00">on his birthday...</font>

478
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,829
I wasn't banning you, Cynthia.

479
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,509
<font color="#00ff00">My only son.</font>

480
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,549
I don't think we got your card
this year, did we, Martin?

481
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,459
I don't think we got your card
this year, did we, Martin?

482
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,429
<font color="#ffff00">Jackie.</font> <font color="#00ff00">That's because I didn't send</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a card.</font>

483
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,509
<font color="#ffff00">Jackie.</font> <font color="#00ff00">That's because I didn't send</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a card.</font>

484
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,909
<font color="#00ffff">Fair enough.</font>

485
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,979
Oh, I thought you were going
to give Martin a present then.

486
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,749
Oh, I thought you were going
to give Martin a present then.

487
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,189
<font color="#ffff00">Bleeding hell, Jackie.</font>

488
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,779
<font color="#00ff00">Why would I give Martin a present?</font>

489
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,429
<font color="#00ffff">His birthday, perhaps?</font>

490
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,989
<font color="#00ff00">But he's not a baby.</font>

491
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,059
Um, that's not quite how birthdays
work...

492
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,019
Um, that's not quite how birthdays
work...

493
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,459
<font color="#00ffff">Horrible...</font>..Grandma.

494
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,469
<font color="#00ff00">I stopped giving Martin presents</font>
<font color="#00ff00">years ago when he was seven.</font>

495
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,979
<font color="#00ff00">I stopped giving Martin presents</font>
<font color="#00ff00">years ago when he was seven.</font>

496
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,949
<font color="#ffff00">Six.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Yes, six.</font>

497
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,309
<font color="#ffff00">Six.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Yes, six.</font>

498
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,349
<font color="#00ff00">I remember, because I just</font>
<font color="#00ff00">re-wrapped the same present</font>

499
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,909
<font color="#00ff00">I remember, because I just</font>
<font color="#00ff00">re-wrapped the same present</font>

500
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,589
<font color="#00ff00">I'd given him when he was five.</font>

501
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,669
SHE LAUGHS

502
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,379
Lovely. <font color="#00ff00">A whistle.</font>

503
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,549
<font color="#00ffff">Lovely.</font>

504
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,589
<font color="#00ff00">Well, he wasn't to know, was he?</font>

505
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,829
<font color="#00ff00">Well, he wasn't to know, was he?</font>

506
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,869
<font color="#ffff00">Jackie, can we bloody eat now?</font>
All right!

507
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,139
<font color="#ffff00">Jackie, can we bloody eat now?</font>
All right!

508
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,579
<font color="#00ff00">I'm looking forward to the beef.</font>

509
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,589
Oh, are you, Cynthia?

510
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,629
<font color="#00ff00">Well, it's about the only thing you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">make that's edible.</font>

511
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,469
<font color="#00ff00">Well, it's about the only thing you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">make that's edible.</font>

512
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,389
<font color="#ffff00">Get rid of her?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">How am I going to get rid of her?</font>

513
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,469
<font color="#00ff00">Er, poison?</font>

514
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,059
<font color="#00ffff">Garrotting?</font> <font color="#00ff00">Drowning in a bucket!</font>

515
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,829
Any of those will do. <font color="#ffff00">Idiots.</font>

516
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,899
I really don't care
how you get rid of her, Martin.

517
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,979
You can take her to Mars
in your spaceship if you like.

518
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,269
You can take her to Mars
in your spaceship if you like.

519
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,829
<font color="#ffff00">Jackie, I don't have a spaceship!</font>

520
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,869
<font color="#ffff00">Ju... OK.</font>

521
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,909
<font color="#ffff00">Let's all just sit down,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">eat our beef and...</font>

522
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,869
<font color="#ffff00">Let's all just sit down,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">eat our beef and...</font>

523
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,939
Eat our beef?! I am not eating
my lovely beef with that... woman!

524
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,019
Eat our beef?! I am not eating
my lovely beef with that... woman!

525
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,669
Eat our beef?! I am not eating
my lovely beef with that... woman!

526
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,469
<font color="#ffff00">But, Jackie...</font>And instead of
looking up

527
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,029
when your wife and kids drop dead,

528
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,099
why don't you look up when your pig
of a mother snuffs it?!

529
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,429
why don't you look up when your pig
of a mother snuffs it?!

530
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,629
<font color="#00ffff">Er, yes, actually!</font>

531
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,429
<font color="#ffff00">Who the hell do you think</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I looked up first?!</font>

532
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,469
And? <font color="#ffff00">She lives to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a shitting hundred.</font>

533
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:51,709
And? <font color="#ffff00">She lives to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a shitting hundred.</font>

534
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,459
<font color="#00ffff">Of course she does.</font>What?!

535
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,429
OK, if you're not going to get
rid of her,

536
